# WordPress boilerplate

This project is here to illustrate almost everything I'm talking inside my blog post:

**[How not to be depressed when working with WordPress, A 2019 sane vision for a cleaner architecture](https://devops-life.com/blog/2019/04/08/state-of-wordpress-in-2019)**

You can find inside this repository examples of
- The Bedrock structure
- Environment variables
- PHP-CS-Fixer pre-configured and ready to use
- Usage of [`yProx-CLI`](https://github.com/Yproximite/yProx-cli) to lint & build JS, CSS and images
- Usage of Timber, which allow to user Twig as a templating system. See their [Sarter theme there](https://github.com/timber/starter-theme)
